You are a mobile-first UI/UX designer and React + Tailwind developer.
Redesign and improve the Garage @ Home mobile hero section based on the current design.

Goals:
- Make the hero section more engaging, compact, and conversion-driven.
- Highlight trust factors (ratings, customers, same-day service) without clutter.
- Ensure clear hierarchy: 1) Value proposition ‚Üí 2) Trust badges ‚Üí 3) CTA.

Improvements Required:

1. Headline & Subtext
- Add back a **short headline** above the image:
  "Doorstep Vehicle Service in Delhi NCR"
- One-line subtext: "Certified mechanics with genuine parts and transparent pricing."
- Keep text size mobile-friendly (headline ~18‚Äì20px, subtext ~14px).

2. Image Section
- Keep the bike mechanic image but **reduce vertical padding**.
- Add **soft gradient overlay at bottom** of image to transition into badges.
- Floating icons (bike, car, wrench) should animate slowly (pulse/float).

3. Trust Badges Row
- Show ‚≠ê 4.9 | üë• 25K+ | ‚ö° Same Day Service in a single **scrollable pill row**.
- Each badge should have subtle gradient background (green, blue, purple).
- Use **Framer Motion stagger animation** so each badge appears one after another.

4. CTA Button
- `Schedule Service` button: full width, gradient (emerald ‚Üí teal ‚Üí sky).
- Add subtle glowing border animation to draw attention.
- Secondary CTA: small text button ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù below.

5. Background & Spacing
- Dark gradient background with diagonal subtle pattern.
- Compact spacing (avoid large empty gaps).
- Keep total hero section height within **70‚Äì75% of viewport**.

6. Animation
- Fade-in headline and subtext from top.
- Image zoom-in slightly on load.
- Badges slide-up one by one.
- CTA button bounce-in.

7. Responsiveness
- Test at **360px width** (Pixel / iPhone SE).
- Ensure floating icons don‚Äôt overlap text/buttons.
- Optimize tap area for Schedule Service.

Deliverables:
- Updated mobile hero section (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion).
- Improved headline, image overlay, animated trust badges, glowing CTA.
- Must look premium and compact, like a high-quality mobile-first startup landing page.
