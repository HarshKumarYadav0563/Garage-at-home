You are a React + Next.js + TailwindCSS engineer.  
Refactor the **Service Package Cards** section to be more **compact and comparison-friendly**.

## Current Issues
- Each card is very tall, with long bullet lists always expanded.
- Prices and CTAs are pushed far down → customers must scroll too much.
- Comparison between plans (General, Periodic, Full) is harder because card heights vary.

## Fixes Needed
1. **Compact Card Design**
   - Card height reduced by collapsing long details.
   - Show only top 3–4 included services by default.
   - Add a “+ View More” link (expand/collapse) for full list.

2. **Pricing & CTA Placement**
   - Always pin **Price** and **Book Now / Add** CTA at the bottom of each card, **visible without scrolling**.
   - Use a sticky footer inside card if content expands.

3. **Card Layout**
   - Header row:
     - Title (e.g., General Service)
     - Badges (Combo, Popular, Save ₹xxx)
   - Subtitle (1 line only)
   - Service highlights (3 bullets)
   - Expandable list hidden until clicked.
   - Footer row: Price + CTA.

4. **Comparison Optimization**
   - All cards in one row (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`).
   - Consistent card height (min-h).
   - Use `flex flex-col justify-between` so price/CTA always align at bottom.
   - Desktop: side-by-side for easy comparison.
   - Mobile: swipeable horizontal scroll (snap-x).

5. **Styling**
   - Cards: glassmorphism `bg-white/5 border border-white/10 rounded-2xl p-4 md:p-6`.
   - Price: gradient text or bold white.
   - CTA: gradient button (`from-emerald-500 via-sky-500 to-indigo-500`).
   - “+ View More” link → `text-xs text-emerald-400 underline cursor-pointer`.

6. **Animations**
   - Cards: fade-up stagger.
   - Expand/collapse: smooth height transition (`framer-motion animate`).
   - CTA hover: glow pulse.

## Deliverables
- Updated `ServicePackageCard.tsx`:
  - Compact card with expandable list.
  - Price + CTA always visible.
- Grid layout responsive:
  - Mobile: horizontal scroll (snap).
  - Desktop: side-by-side comparison.
- No card exceeds ~450px height collapsed.
