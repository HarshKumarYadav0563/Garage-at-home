You are a creative React + Next.js + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + Lottie expert.  
Refactor the "How Garage At Home Works" section to look **awesome, premium, and animated**.

## Visual Style
- Replace current stock-like illustrations with **modern, vector-3D hybrid illustrations**.
- Style: Gradient-rich, semi-3D, futuristic SaaS illustrations (green/blue/purple neon tones).
- Each step should feel like part of a single journey (consistent color palette, perspective, and depth).
- Background: subtle gradient + particle glow effect (floating dots, blurred circles).
- Use SVGs or Lottie JSONs for lightweight animation.

## Steps (Illustration Prompts)
1. **Book Online**  
   - A user holding a phone with a glowing app UI and a mechanic icon.  
   - Theme: instant booking, mobile-first convenience.  

2. **Get Confirmation**  
   - A phone screen with a big checkmark, mechanic avatar, and notification popup.  
   - Theme: trust + transparency.  

3. **Mechanic Arrives**  
   - A mechanic with a toolkit standing next to a car/bike parked outside a house.  
   - Theme: doorstep convenience, professional service.  

4. **Service Complete**  
   - Happy customer with vehicle shining, a big glowing checkmark/star floating above.  
   - Theme: quality, satisfaction, guarantee.

## Animations
- **Cards**: fade-up + scale-in with stagger (`delay = index * 0.3s`).
- **Illustrations**: subtle floating loop (`y: [0, -10, 0]`, `duration: 3s`, repeat).
- **Connecting Line**: animate left → right as user scrolls into view, with glowing gradient sweep.
- **Step Indicator Dots**: glow pulse animation (active step brighter).
- **Hover**: card lifts slightly (`scale: 1.05`, shadow glow).
- **Mobile**: use a vertical timeline style (each step slides in from left/right with illustration floating).

## Layout
- Desktop: 4 horizontal cards with connecting animated line below illustrations.
- Tablet: 2x2 grid with connecting line animating in zig-zag.
- Mobile: vertical timeline (illustration → text), animated connector line with dots.

## Deliverables
- Updated `HowItWorks.tsx`:
  - Uses Framer Motion for stagger + floating animations.
  - Animated gradient line that connects steps.
  - Responsive layout (4 → 2 → 1).
- `assets/how-it-works/` folder with new illustrations (SVG/Lottie).
- Optional: Lottie JSON animations for illustrations (glowing phone, waving mechanic, shining vehicle).
